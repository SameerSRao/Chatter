# Chatter - A Django-Based Real-Time Chat Application with AI Chatbot Integration

## Description

**Chatter** is a real-time chat application built using Django, Django Channels, and WebSockets. The application supports multiple chat rooms, user authentication, and features a simple AI chatbot that interacts with users, providing assistance and entertainment. The AI chatbot includes a basic keyword-matching system and supports playing games like Hangman. Additionally, the application includes a recap feature that summarizes missed messages, ensuring users stay updated with ongoing conversations.

## Features
1. Real-Time Chat

    - WebSockets: Leveraging Django Channels for real-time communication, enabling users to chat instantly in various chat rooms.
    - Multiple Chat Rooms: Users can create, join, and leave chat rooms. Each room is independent, and users can participate in multiple rooms.
    - Message History: Chat history is stored and loaded when a user joins a room, ensuring that conversations persist across sessions.
    - User Authentication: Integrated user registration and login system using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication framework.

2. AI Chatbot

    - Keyword Matching: The chatbot responds to specific commands or keywords, providing pre-defined responses to user queries.
    - Hangman Game: Users can play a game of Hangman by entering the !hangman command. The bot manages the game state, taking guesses and providing feedback.
    - Custom Responses: The chatbot can be easily extended with new responses and commands.

3. Recap Feature

    - Automatic Recap Summary: When users rejoin a chat room, they receive a recap of all the messages they missed since their last visit, helping them catch up on important discussions.

4. User Interface

    - Bootstrap-Enhanced UI: A clean, responsive interface built with Bootstrap, offering an intuitive user experience.
    - Message Bubbles: User messages are displayed in styled chat bubbles, with different colors for users and the chatbot.
    - Scroll Management: Automatic scrolling ensures that users always see the latest messages without manual intervention.

5. Admin Features

    - Manage Users and Rooms: Administrators can manage chat rooms and users through Django's admin panel.
    - Message Moderation: Admins can delete messages or clean up chat histories if necessary.
    - User Roles: Different user roles (e.g., Admin, Moderator, Regular User) can be assigned to manage permissions.
