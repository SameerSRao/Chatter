# Chatter - A Django-Based Real-Time Chat Application with AI Chatbot Integration

## Description

**Chatter** is a real-time chat application built using Django, Django Channels, and WebSockets. The application supports multiple chat rooms, user authentication, and features a simple AI chatbot that interacts with users, providing assistance and entertainment. The AI chatbot includes a basic keyword-matching system and supports playing games like Hangman. Additionally, the application includes a recap feature that summarizes missed messages, ensuring users stay updated with ongoing conversations.

## Features
1. Real-Time Chat
   * WebSockets: Leveraging Django Channels for real-time communication, enabling users to chat instantly in various chat rooms.
   * Multiple Chat Rooms: Users can create, join, and leave chat rooms. Each room is independent, and users can participate in multiple rooms.
   * Message History: Chat history is stored and loaded when a user joins a room, ensuring that conversations persist across sessions.
   * User Authentication: Integrated user registration and login system using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication framework.

3. AI Chatbot
   * Keyword Matching: The chatbot responds to specific commands or keywords, providing pre-defined responses to user queries.
   * Hangman Game: Users can play a game of Hangman by entering the !hangman command. The bot manages the game state, taking guesses and providing feedback.
   * Custom Responses: The chatbot can be easily extended with new responses and commands.

5. Recap Feature
   * Automatic Recap Summary: When users rejoin a chat room, they receive a recap of all the messages they missed since their last visit, helping them catch up on important discussions.

7. User Interface
   * Bootstrap-Enhanced UI: A clean, responsive interface built with Bootstrap, offering an intuitive user experience.
   * Message Bubbles: User messages are displayed in styled chat bubbles, with different colors for users and the chatbot.
   * Scroll Management: Automatic scrolling ensures that users always see the latest messages without manual intervention.

9. Admin Features
    * Manage Users and Rooms: Administrators can manage chat rooms and users through Django's admin panel.
    * Message Moderation: Admins can delete messages or clean up chat histories if necessary.
    * User Roles: Different user roles (e.g., Admin, Moderator, Regular User) can be assigned to manage permissions.
